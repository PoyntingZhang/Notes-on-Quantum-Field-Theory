A Dirac spinor contains four complex components, should there be 8 independent real scalar fields?
The equation of motion of Dirac field is first order in time. Hence the conjugate moment of field is independent on time. The dimension of the phase space of the Dirac spinor is just 8.
Hence the degrees of freedom of the spinor is just half the phase space dimension, which is 4.
